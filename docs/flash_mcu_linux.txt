# Flashing the MCU from linux

In order to flash the MCU from linux distro's, you'll basically need dfu-util

	1. Set up dfu-util
		a. Download from their git repo
		b. ```
			./autogen.h
			./configure
			make
			sudo make install
		```
	2. Put board in DFU mode
		a. Power off board
		b. remove SD card
		c. hold SELECT + RE/SET buttons WHILE BOARD IS UNPLUGGED
		d. While still holding buttons, plug in. Hold button until White LED turns off
		e. check for the most recent device in dmesg for "Product: STM32 BOOTLOADER".
			If this shows up it worked. 
	3. run "sudo dfu-util -l" to ensure device enumerated
	4. the MCU internal flash requires -a 1, whereas -a 0 will get you the options flags
	5. You can test dumping using "sudo dfu-util -a 1 -u testdump.bin" if this is the only dfu device hooked up to your PC
